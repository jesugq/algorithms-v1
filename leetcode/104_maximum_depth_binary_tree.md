# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Description

Given a binary tree, find its maximum depth.

The maximum depth is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example**:

Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

        3
      /   \
    9       20
          /    \
        15      7

Return its depth = 3.

## Learnings

First we have to find out how to traverse the node. And then I just finish the code.

I realized that making code look good is still difficult, despite knowing now how to name functions. At least now I can make the functions small by making them 'read like well written pose'.
